Day 1: Historian Hysteria
-------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** Simple string splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** List manipulation with a dash of `Map`.


Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports
------------------------

**Language used:** Haskell

**Parsing strategy:** Simple string splitting

**Thoughts on the puzzle:** Didn't try to clever, just implemented the
problem as stated. Decided to go with simple (tail) recursion rather
than a fold for part 1, simply because it felt more elegant at the
time of writing. In part 2, I'm not completely happy with the
definition of `reports` in `isKindaSafe`, it feels to imperative.
